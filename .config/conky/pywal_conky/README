# Simple Conky Skin with pywal integration

If you have pywal installed it will take the colors from wallpaper.
Best to use with dwm,xwallpaper, and sxhkd (for keyboard shortcuts)

It uses the bash script `conkypywalcolors.sh` to fetch colors from `~/.cache/wal/colors` 
and paste into `latestcolors` then output of `conkyseed` and `latestcolors` will be
merge into conkyrc.

So if you want to edit the skin edit the `conkyseed` file and run bash script it will update the conkyrc file
